# Apollo Cards 

Apollo Cards is a flashcard and memory-training engine designed around
**retention under pressure**, not dopamine-driven gamification.

This project explores how difficulty, timing, and failure states affect long-term recall.


## Planned Features

- Adaptive review modes (timed, typed recall, fail-stack reset)
- Deterministic + randomized review flows
- Import/export compatibility
- Community-shared decks (opt-in)
- Custom retention algorithm

---

## Non-Goals

- No streaks
- No XP
- No social pressure mechanics
- No artificial engagement loops

---

## Status

Early development  
Architecture-first. UX second. Polish last.

---

## Tech Stack

- Rust (core engine)
- Modular crate-based architecture

---

## Vision

Apollo Cards is built for people who care about **mastery**, not metrics.

If you fail a card, you earn it back.
If you pass a deck, you *deserve* it.
